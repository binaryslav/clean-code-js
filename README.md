Q&A:

Q: What have been changed?
A: 
 1) Navigation: removed all annoying links to the table of content to reduce visual noise and overall document weight.
 2) Structure: SOLID principles chapter has been extended with Other , .
 3) Readability: less words. Definitions first. Semantic intendation. References and external links.


Q: How to use your new navigation?
A: Ctrl + Left Click to access a specific chapter from Contents and Ctrl + G  (--> 1) in your IDE/text editor to jump back to the content table.


Q: How do I know is this information still relevant today?
A: Search google for the specification(TC39);... look at the date of the last commit/comment. Some of the information (e.g. Problem complexity etc) has a universal, interdisciplinary and timeless value.


Q: How to contribute? /n
